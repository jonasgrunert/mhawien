This workshop is a space for BIPoC (Black, Indigenous or People of Colour) active in the fields of psychology, psychotherapy or other psychosocial work to connect, critically reflect and discuss how we navigate psychosocial fields as BIPoC practitioners. As people who experience different forms of oppression, it is important to recognize our shared experiences with our clients/patients as both a resource and a possible limitation. During the workshop we will ponder about different aspects of our practice within the various boundaries and hierarchies of oppression.
