The speaker orchi currently works as a trainer focusing on different issues like anti-racism, intersectional anti-bias and anti-imperialism. They has worked with Bangladesh's first emotional support and suicide prevention helpline, as a trainer for some years before they moved to the EU. This event is focusing around mental health and systemic capitalism, with the lens of intersectionality - given the fact that orchi is a neurodivergent, autistic, queer, trans migrant of colour from the 'Global South'. After the input  there is going to be an opportunity for exchange and questions. The target group for this lecture is everyone under capitalism, which is everyone. This event will be held in English. However, no special English skills are necessary. This event is hybrid.
