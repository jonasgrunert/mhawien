For trans\*inter\*nonbinary and other gender nonconforming people, dominant understandings of care are often linked with violence. At the same time, as human beings and given the climate of trans\*-, inter\*-, queer and nonbinary hostility, care is something we cannot not want. The workshop looks at TIN for TIN care, at its world changing potential and its perpetuation of racist and classist dynamics of exploitation and its often ableist assumptions.

Starting from writings from trans* and gendernonconforming authors and activists, the workshop turns toward our own experiences to ask if and how we can live and practice TIN4TIN care in a critical and emancipatory way.
