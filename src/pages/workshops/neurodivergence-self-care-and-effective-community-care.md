We will contextualize self care and neurodivergence in the context of achievement-oriented societies and wage labor, discuss neurotypical norms, work out strategies for neurodivergent solidarity & allyship, potential kinds of mutual help and how communal spaces can be created more thoughtfully.

The event is a mix of informative inputs, interactive tasks, group discussions and a collaborative Q&A (you don't have to partake, sitting back at any point is perfectly fine).

It will be held in English, but we'll try to translate into German whenever necessary.
